# OOP Project

This is Project of our team in OOP class.
This project is a simulation of an app which will generate sentences describing the status stock price with data crawled in website cafef.vn, then stored in an excel file. 

The sentences used to generate were semi-manual processed. We manually gathered some sentences with the same rule in one file, then write code to modelize that one into modelized sentences. The modelized sentences contain keywords which will be replaced by status words ( or may be crawled data, preprocessed data,...) when generated.

Beside, the project also visualizes data in the 20 day latest with a candlestick chart. The code for candlestick chart was copied from 2 following links ( which were almost the same):
